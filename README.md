# FFmpeg Video Analytics (FFVA) Plugin

## Overview

This repository contains FFmpeg patches that enable CNN model-based video analytics capabilities in the FFmpeg framework. These patches contain filter based implementation include such things as object detection, classification, and recognition. Following is an example that runs detection & emotion classification, using specific models on a video file:
```sh
ffmpeg -i test.mp4 -vf detect=model=face-detection-adas-0001.xml:model_proc=face-detection-adas-0001.json,classify=model=emotions-recognition-retail-0003.xml:model_proc=emotions-recognition-retail-0003.json -an -f null -
```

The solution leverages:
* Open-source FFmpeg framework for pipeline management
* FFmpeg components for input and output, such as media files and real-time streaming from a camera or network
* Video decode and encode plugins, including either CPU-optimized plugins or GPU-accelerated plugins, [based on VAAPI](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Hardware/VAAPI)

In addition, the solution installs the following Deep Learning-specific elements, also available in this repository:
* Inference plugins leveraging [OpenVINO<sup>&#8482;</sup> Toolkit](https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit) for high-performance inference using CNN models
* Visualization of computer vision results (such as bounding boxes and labels of detected objects) on top of video stream
